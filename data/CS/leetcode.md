| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Most commonly solutions to Tree problems mostly involve | DFS and BFS |
| When solving a problem that outputs multiple similar trees you might find yourself cloning the tree in a recursive function. To avoid cloning the trees you should instead. | Build the tree from the leaf nodes |
| When presented with a sorted array what algorithm should see if you can apply | Binary Search |
| When comparing two arrays and you know they supposed to have identical values or one is missing some values. What can you do instead of comparing all of the elements | Compare array lengths instead |
| For questions involving finding the shortest path or minimum steps in a grid or graph, what approach is often effective? | Using a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm |
| When dealing with string manipulation problems, especially involving substrings or anagrams, what is a common technique? | Utilizing a sliding window technique |
| How to optimize a brute-force solution in problems involving finding maximum or minimum subsets? | Dynamic Programming to avoid redundant calculations |
| When a problem involves balancing parentheses or evaluating expressions, what data structure is typically useful? | Stack |
| What approach should be considered when you need to process tasks in the order they arrive? | Queue, especially a priority queue for tasks with different priorities |
| If a problem involves large numbers of insertions, deletions, and finding the median, which data structure can be efficient? | Heap (Min-Heap or Max-Heap) |
| In problems where you need to frequently check if an item exists in a collection, what data structure can offer efficient lookups? | Hash Table or Hash Set |
| When solving problems that require decisions at each step to maximize or minimize certain values, what technique is often useful? | Greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step |
