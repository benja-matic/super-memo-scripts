    },
    {
        "question": "Mnemonic: \"Anchor weighs down, guiding judgment's town!\" In the context of negotiations or estimates, how does an established anchor play a role?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Active Recall: If a company first quotes a high price for a service and later offers a discount, how might the initial price impact the perceived value of the discounted price? ",
        "answer": "Due to the anchoring effect, the discounted price will seem like a much better deal, even if it's still high, because the perception is anchored to the initially quoted higher price."
    },
    {
        "question": "Simplicity: How does the anchoring effect manipulate one's perception in decision-making? ",
