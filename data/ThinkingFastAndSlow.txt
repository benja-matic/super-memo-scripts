---

**Flashcard 3**:

**Front**: What term describes the phenomenon where one's self-control and decision-making ability are weakened after engaging in a mentally demanding task?

**Back**: "Ego depletion."

**Mnemonic**: Imagine an ego balloon deflating after each mentally challenging task.

---

**Flashcard 4**:

**Front**: Why is understanding "ego depletion" crucial for assessing human behavior and choices?

**Back**: It provides insight into why individuals might act impulsively or make less rational decisions after periods of intensive mental exertion.

**Mnemonic**: Visualize a person choosing to eat junk food right after taking a long, mentally draining exam.

---

**Flashcard 5** (Comparison Card):

**Front**: Differentiate between the mental states of someone experiencing "ego depletion" versus someone fully rested.

**Back**:

- **Ego-depleted**: Lower self-control, increased impulsivity, reduced decision-making capability.
- **Fully Rested**: Higher self-control, less impulsivity, optimized decision-making capability.

**Mnemonic**: Think of a car: "ego-depleted" is like running on low fuel while "fully rested" is a car with a full tank and tuned-up engine.

6. flashcards based on the "Polar Bear Experiment" from Chapter 2 of "Thinking, Fast and Slow":

---

**Flashcard 1**:

**Front**: Describe the main task given to participants in the Polar Bear Experiment.

**Back**: Participants were instructed not to think about a white bear.

**Mnemonic**: Visualize a sign saying "No White Bears Allowed".

---

**Flashcard 2**:

**Front**: What was the common result experienced by most participants in the Polar Bear Experiment?

**Back**: They found it challenging to suppress the thought of the white bear and frequently ended up thinking about it.

**Mnemonic**: Think of a white bear constantly popping up in a game of "Whack-a-Mole".

---

**Flashcard 3**:

**Front**: What main insight about thought control does the Polar Bear Experiment demonstrate?

**Back**: It highlights the difficulty of controlling (especially suppressing) specific thoughts, as doing so often requires significant mental effort.

**Mnemonic**: Imagine trying to push a giant inflatable white bear under water — it keeps popping back up!

---

**Flashcard 4**:

**Front**: According to the insights from the Polar Bear Experiment, what might be the cognitive implication of trying to suppress unwanted thoughts?

**Back**: Continuously attempting to suppress thoughts can be mentally draining, and it can lead to an increase in the frequency of those very thoughts.

**Mnemonic**: The more you push the "Do Not Press" button in your mind, the more you're tempted to press it.

---

**Flashcard 5** (Comparison Card):

**Front**: Differentiate between actively thinking about a subject vs. trying to suppress thoughts about the same subject.

**Back**:

- **Actively Thinking**: Deliberate focus and engagement with the subject, can be less mentally draining.
- **Suppressing Thoughts**: Attempting to push the subject out of one's mind, often leads to increased mental effort and potential backfire by thinking about it more.

**Mnemonic**: It's like holding a ball in your hand (active thinking) versus trying to keep a floating ball submerged in water (suppressing thoughts).

7. Let's create flashcards based on the "Divided Attention" concept from Chapter 2 of "Thinking, Fast and Slow":

---

**Flashcard 1**:

**Front**: What happens when people divide their attention between two tasks that both require System 2 thinking?

**Back**: Performance can degrade on both tasks due to the limited resources of System 2 thinking.

**Mnemonic**: Imagine trying to juggle two heavy objects simultaneously — both are likely to drop.

---

**Flashcard 2**:

**Front**: Describe a common real-life phenomenon that exemplifies the challenge of dividing attention between two demanding tasks.

**Back**: Often, people will stop walking when faced with a tough question during a conversation, showcasing the interference between the demanding tasks of walking and deep thinking.

**Mnemonic**: Picture a person frozen in mid-step, deep in thought, while trying to answer a challenging question.

---

**Flashcard 3**:

**Front**: Why might a seemingly simple task like walking be impacted when combined with a demanding cognitive task?

**Back**: Although walking is typically a System 1 activity, when combined with a demanding System 2 task, it may require more conscious effort and thus be impacted.

**Mnemonic**: Think of walking on a straight path (easy) but then suddenly being asked to walk on a tightrope while solving a math problem.

---

**Flashcard 4** (Comparison Card):

**Front**: Compare System 1 tasks and System 2 tasks in terms of divided attention.

**Back**: 
- **System 1 Tasks**: Automatic, often can be combined without significant performance loss (e.g., walking while talking).
- **System 2 Tasks**: Deliberate and resource-intensive. Combining two System 2 tasks often results in degraded performance on both.

**Mnemonic**: System 1 is like background music you can tune out, while System 2 is like trying to listen to two podcasts at once.

---

8. Let's design flashcards focusing on the "Feedback" concept from Chapter 2 of "Thinking, Fast and Slow":

---

**Flashcard 1**:

**Front**: How does System 2 react to clear feedback that action is required?

**Back**: System 2 is more likely to engage and allocate effort when it receives clear feedback necessitating action.

**Mnemonic**: Imagine a dormant engine roaring to life when it senses the need (clear feedback).

---

**Flashcard 2**:

**Front**: What can be the consequence when System 2 does not receive clear feedback?

**Back**: Without clear feedback, System 2 might remain passive, leading to errors that go uncorrected.

**Mnemonic**: Visualize a machine missing a glitch because no warning light (feedback) flashed.

---

**Flashcard 3**:

**Front**: Why is feedback essential for the activation of System 2?

**Back**: Feedback serves as an alert mechanism that wakes up System 2 from its passive mode, prompting it to engage in the situation or problem at hand.

**Mnemonic**: Think of feedback as an alarm bell that rouses a sleeping guard (System 2).

---

**Flashcard 4** (Comparison Card):

**Front**: Compare the responses of System 2 with and without clear feedback.

**Back**: 
- **With Clear Feedback**: System 2 engages, becomes active, and allocates the required effort.
- **Without Clear Feedback**: System 2 remains passive and potential errors might not be addressed.

**Mnemonic**: It's like the difference between a vigilant watchman alerted by a siren versus one dozing off without any alarm.

---

9. Designing flashcards focusing on the "Expertise and Intuition" concept from Chapter 2 of "Thinking, Fast and Slow":

---

**Flashcard 1**:

**Front**: How does expertise affect the role of System 2 in task execution?

**Back**: With adequate training and expertise, tasks that initially necessitated System 2 thinking can become more automatic, shifting towards System 1.

**Mnemonic**: Imagine a rocky, challenging path (System 2) that, over time with frequent travel, becomes a smooth paved road (System 1).

---

**Flashcard 2**:

**Front**: What is the impact of expertise on pattern recognition, especially in complex tasks like chess?

**Back**: Chess masters, with their expertise, can intuitively recognize intricate patterns on the chessboard, reducing the need for deliberation compared to novices.

**Mnemonic**: Visualize a chess master effortlessly dancing across the board, while a novice ponders each step.

---

**Flashcard 3**:

**Front**: How does the development of expertise relate to the transition from deliberate thinking to intuition?

**Back**: As one develops expertise, the need for deliberate, conscious thought (System 2) diminishes, and intuition (System 1) begins to play a more dominant role.

**Mnemonic**: Picture a student slowly turning into a master, with the gears in their head (System 2) gradually quieting down as intuition takes the lead.

---

**Flashcard 4** (Comparison Card):

**Front**: Compare the decision-making process of an expert versus a novice in a specialized task.

**Back**: 
- **Expert**: Intuitive, quick recognition of patterns, minimal deliberation, mostly System 1 driven.
- **Novice**: More deliberate thinking, slower decision-making, heavy reliance on System 2.

**Mnemonic**: It's like comparing an eagle swiftly spotting its prey versus a young bird hesitantly searching.

---

 10. **Flashcard Designs for "Thinking, Fast and Slow" - Chapter Three: "The Anchoring Effect"**

---

**Flashcard 1**:  
**Front**: Mnemonic: "First info fixates, making future estimates!"  
**Question**: What is the essential concept behind the anchoring effect?  
**Back**: An initial piece of information, known as the "anchor", plays a significant role in influencing subsequent judgments or decisions.

---

**Flashcard 2**:  
**Front**: Active Recall: Imagine you're at a car dealership and the salesperson first shows you a luxury car priced at $100,000. Later, they show a car priced at $40,000. How might the first car's price affect your perception of the second car's value?  
**Back**: Due to the anchoring effect, the second car might seem relatively inexpensive or a better deal in comparison to the first luxury car's price.

---

**Flashcard 3**:  
**Front**: Simplicity: What term describes the phenomenon where one piece of information influences future decisions?  
**Back**: Anchoring.

---

**Flashcard 4**:  
**Front**: Comparison Card: "Seeing an expensive item first vs. Seeing a cheaper item first".  
**Question**: How might these two scenarios differently impact a shopper's perception of subsequent product prices?  
**Back**: When seeing an expensive item first, subsequent items might seem more affordable in comparison. Conversely, seeing a cheaper item first may make subsequent items seem overpriced.

---

**Flashcard 5**:  
**Front**: Mnemonic: "Anchor weighs down, guiding judgment's town!"  
**Question**: In the context of negotiations or estimates, how does an established anchor play a role?  
**Back**: Once an anchor is set, all subsequent discussions and estimations tend to revolve around or be influenced by that anchored value.

---

**Flashcard 6**:  
**Front**: Active Recall: If a company first quotes a high price for a service and later offers a discount, how might the initial price impact the perceived value of the discounted price?  
**Back**: Due to the anchoring effect, the discounted price will seem like a much better deal, even if it's still high, because the perception is anchored to the initially quoted higher price.

---

**Flashcard 7**:  
**Front**: Simplicity: How does the anchoring effect manipulate one's perception in decision-making?  
**Back**: It biases perceptions and decisions based on the initial information presented, even if it's irrelevant.

---

**Flashcard 8**:  
**Front**: Comparison Card: "High starting salary vs. Low starting salary negotiation".  
**Question**: In job negotiations, how might these two starting points influence the final agreed-upon salary?  
**Back**: A high starting salary serves as an anchor, likely resulting in a higher final salary, while a low starting salary can lead to a final agreement closer to that lower amount.
